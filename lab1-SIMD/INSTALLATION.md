# Required Software

To participate in the SIMD/MMX/SSE/AVX labs, you will need:
- A C/C++ compiler
- A code editor (some IDEs already include a compiler)
- The OpenCV library (used to display images in exercises 3&4)

The instructions below will help you install and configure these tools.

## Preliminary note

If you use the machines provided by TSE, check the version of Windows (Windows 7 ?)
and Visual Studio 2015(or 2019) that you need to do the labs. Visual Studio Code might be pre-installed 
otherwise you may install the lastest version on the machine.

If you use your personal laptop, ensure that your laptop is equipped with the following.
- A well equiped computer (VS2019 requires at least 2GB RAM...)
- Windows (i.e. at least additional 4GB RAM...)

In general the labs have been adapted to work under Windows or Linux with very lightweight software (~200MB).

You can execute your lab work under the following environments:
- Text/Code Editor + Manual compilation
- Code::Blocks
- QtCreator
- VSCode + C/C++ Extension
- Visual Studio 2019 (Windows Only)

In the zip file provided with the skeleton code you'll complete, there
are project files for these tools. **Unfortunately, you might be using
another OS, another compiler, another installation path for OpenCV,
etc. than I did when I created them. Thus these files will need to be
adapted.**

**For this year, I'll ask you as much as possible to use QTCreator, as
it will ease my job if everybody uses the same tool.**

Below, you'll find instructions to install these software.

# Configuration of the tools

Whatever the tools you have installed, you'll need to configure:
1. The compiler
   1. to use the special SIMD instructions (i.e. compile for an
   architecture that is more evolved than the default i386)
   2. to find the OpenCV's include/header (.h) files
2. The linker:
   - to find the OpenCV's (`.dll`/`.so`) libraries files

I'll try below to provide the instruction for each tool.

# Manual Compilation

For reference, I give you below the format of the commandline that you
would have to write if you would compile manually, as it provides the
options you'll have to configure with your IDE.

```
/usr/bin/g++ \
              -march=haswell \                          # (1a) type of target machine [haswell is old but supports all the instructions we need]
              -g <file1>.cpp <file...>.cpp <filen>.cpp\ # cpp files to compile [BEWARE THE ORDER]
              -o <file>.exe \                           # name of the executable to produce
              -I/usr/include/                           # (1b) dir where to find OpenCV's include (.h) files
              -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/\             # (2) dir where to find OpenCV's lib (dll/so) files
              -lopencv_aruco -lopencv_bgsegm -lopencv_bioinspired -lopencv_calib3d -lopencv_ccalib -lopencv_core -lopencv_datasets -lopencv_dpm -lopencv_face -lopencv_features2d -lopencv_flann -lopencv_freetype -lopencv_fuzzy -lopencv_hdf -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_imgcodecs -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_line_descriptor -lopencv_ml -lopencv_objdetect -lopencv_optflow -lopencv_phase_unwrapping -lopencv_photo -lopencv_plot -lopencv_reg -lopencv_rgbd -lopencv_saliency -lopencv_shape -lopencv_stereo -lopencv_stitching -lopencv_structured_light -lopencv_superres -lopencv_surface_matching -lopencv_text -lopencv_video -lopencv_videoio -lopencv_videostab -lopencv_viz -lopencv_ximgproc -lopencv_xobjdetect -lopencv_xphoto                                                # the OpenCV libraries themselves [format is -l<name of the lib file minus 'lib' prefix and minus '.dll/so' suffix>]
                                                         # [might be simply -lopencv_worldxxx with some installations]
```



## Code::Blocks [BEWARE: create a Console application]

Right click on project > "Build Options" > **Select the whole project** (NOT Release/Debug)

+ For the compiler (1.1. architecture)
  - Select "Compiler Settings" tab
  - You could set it in the "Compiler Flags" panel
  - But there is no "Haswell" architecture choice, => in "Other compiler options" panel, add `-march=haswell`

+ For the compiler (1b. includes)
  - Select "Search directories" tab
  - Click "Add" button and use the dialogbox to find OpenCV's `include` dir

+ For the linker (2. libs)
  - Select "Linker Settings" tab
  - Under the "Link libraries" click "Add" button
  - In the dialog box that appears, find OpenCV's `lib` dir
  - NOTE: in this dialogbox, you can select multiple (lib) files at once



## QtCreator  [BEWARE: create a Non-Qt Console application]

When you create a project, QtCreator creates a `.pro` file with all
the configs in it.

You'll add a few lines to this file.

+ For the compiler (1.1. architecture)
  `QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -march=haswell`


+ For the compiler (1b. includes)
  `INCLUDES += -I/usr/include/opencv2/`

+ For the linker (2. libs)
```
  LIBS += -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ \
             -lopencv_aruco -lopencv_bgsegm -lopencv_bioinspired -lopencv_calib3d -lopencv_ccalib -lopencv_core -lopencv_datasets -lopencv_dpm -lopencv_face -lopencv_features2d -lopencv_flann -lopencv_freetype -lopencv_fuzzy -lopencv_hdf -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_imgcodecs -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_line_descriptor -lopencv_ml -lopencv_objdetect -lopencv_optflow -lopencv_phase_unwrapping -lopencv_photo -lopencv_plot -lopencv_reg -lopencv_rgbd -lopencv_saliency -lopencv_shape -lopencv_stereo -lopencv_stitching -lopencv_structured_light -lopencv_superres -lopencv_surface_matching -lopencv_text -lopencv_video -lopencv_videoio -lopencv_videostab -lopencv_viz -lopencv_ximgproc -lopencv_xobjdetect -lopencv_xphoto
```



## VSCode

+ For the compiler (1b. includes)
  VSCode will generally automatically detect the include path


+ For the compiler (1.1. architecture) & For the linker (2. libs)

  + You need to create a `.vscode/tasks.json` and a
  `.vscode/launch.json` file in the project dir. VSCode will generally
  generate them automatically when asked by clicking on "Menu
  Terminal" > "Configure Tasks"/"Configure Default Build Task" and
  "Menu Run" > "Open Configurations"/"Add Configuration".

  + `tasks.json` (with '#' are parts you might have to change)
```
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "type": "shell",
            "label": "Build",
            "command": "/usr/bin/g++",  ## path the the compiler
            "args": [
                "-march=haswell",       ## (1a) architecture that support SIMD
                "-g",
                "${file}",              ## cpp file to compile
                "-o",
                "${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}" ## output file
                "-L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/",     ## (2) path where to find OpenCV's libs
                "-lopencv_aruco", "-lopencv_bgsegm", "-lopencv_bioinspired", "-lopencv_calib3d", "-lopencv_ccalib", "-lopencv_core", "-lopencv_datasets", "-lopencv_dpm", "-lopencv_face", "-lopencv_features2d", "-lopencv_flann", "-lopencv_freetype", "-lopencv_fuzzy", "-lopencv_hdf", "-lopencv_highgui", "-lopencv_imgcodecs", "-lopencv_imgproc", "-lopencv_line_descriptor", "-lopencv_ml", "-lopencv_objdetect", "-lopencv_optflow", "-lopencv_phase_unwrapping", "-lopencv_photo", "-lopencv_plot", "-lopencv_reg", "-lopencv_rgbd", "-lopencv_saliency", "-lopencv_shape", "-lopencv_stereo", "-lopencv_stitching", "-lopencv_structured_light", "-lopencv_superres", "-lopencv_surface_matching", "-lopencv_text", "-lopencv_video", "-lopencv_videoio", "-lopencv_videostab", "-lopencv_viz", "-lopencv_ximgproc", "-lopencv_xobjdetect", "-lopencv_xphoto"                  ## libs used in the project
            ],
            "options": {
                "cwd": "/usr/bin"
            },
            "problemMatcher": [],
            "group": "build"
        },
        {
            "type": "shell",
            "label": "Run",
            "command": "${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}",
            "problemMatcher": [],
            "group": "build"
        }
    ]
}
```

  + `launch.json` (you're not supposed to change anything there)
```
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
      {
        "name": "g++ build and debug active file",
        "type": "cppdbg",
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}",  ## file to debug

        "stopAtEntry": false,
        "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
        "environment": [],
        "externalConsole": false,
        "MIMode": "gdb",
        "setupCommands": [
          {
            "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
            "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
            "ignoreFailures": true
          }
        ],
        "preLaunchTask": "Build",
        "miDebuggerPath": "/usr/bin/gdb"      ## path to the debugger (included with the compiler)
      }
    ]
  }
```

## Visual Studio [BEWARE: Create a Windows Console Application]

+ For the compiler (1.1. architecture)
  + Go to "Project" > "Properties" > "Configuration Properties" > "C/C++" > "Code Generation"
  + "Enable Enhanced Instruction Set" or append /arch:SSE (or /arch:SSE2) in "Command Line" > "Additional Options".

+ For the compiler (1b.includes)
  + Right Click on your *project* > Properties
  + In "Configuration", select "All Configurations"
  + In "C/C++" > "General" > "Additional Include Directories"

+ For the linker (2.libs)
  + Right Click on your *project* > Properties
  + In "Configuration", select "All Configurations"
  + In "Linker" > "Input" > "Additional Dependencies"



## Other Tips & Tricks

### Accessing the assembly code

- Add a Break Point where you want to get the assembly
- Run your application in debug mode until thi point
- When the debugger stops on the  Break Point, follow the steps below according to the tool you use.

+ QtCreator
  + At the bottom of the Debugger view, there's a panel with a table with the name of your file, a line number and nan address.
    [screenshot](../resources/figures/QtCreator.png)
  + Right click on this line and select "Open Disassembler at 0x....."
  + Also See: https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-debug-mode.html#viewing-disassembled-code

+ Code::Blocks
  + Menu "Debug" > "Debugging Windows" > "Assembly"

+ Visual Studio
  + Right click in the "code window" > "Goto to disassembly" (Visual Studio)

+ VSCode
  + does not seem to support the feature
    + You're supposed to be able to use `-exec disassembly` in the "debugger console" but that did not work for me.
      https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues/206#issuecomment-245776970
    + Under Linux you could show disassembly with the external tool `nemiver`

### Using cmake
```
set(GCC_COVERAGE_COMPILE_FLAGS "-march=haswell")
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} ${GCC_COVERAGE_COMPILE_FLAGS}")
```
