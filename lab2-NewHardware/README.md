# Emerging technologies in HPP

## Lab Objectives

HPP is an ever evolving topic. New technologies, frameworks, tools
appear every day. We unfortunately can't cover all HPP subjects in
this short course, whereas, it would be interesting to have at least
basic knowledge about all these topics.

The Lab#4 is dedicated to let you discover trending or established
subjects in an original format, the "inverted classroom": in small
groups, you'll dive into *one* of these technologies/frameworks/tools,
understand what it does & what it does not, what are its pros &
cons, etc. and then share your knowledge with your peers in a
presentation.

Thanks to this approach, you'll be able to acquire *both* a deep
understanding of one of these HPP subjects *and* a broad overview of
HPP.

We will create groups of 2 students (*), for each group will be assigned
one of the following topics:

If none of the topics above you can also pick one within the topics that were proposed (but not studied) last year: [Emerging technologies in HPP 2019-2020](../lab3-2019-2020/README.md#topics).

**(*) All members of a group are supposed to work equally, thus the final grade is supposed to be the same for all members of the group. However, if we (teachers) detect that the work was not distributed equally between the members of a group, we reserve the right to differentiate the grades within this group.**

## Topics

The session on the 1rst & 15th of April are made for you to research and understand your assigned topic as a group.

The session on the 29th of April is made for you to present your assigned topic to the rest of the class.
To this end, you will provide a [slide deck](https://mootse.telecom-st-etienne.fr/mod/assign/view.php?id=16924) for an oral presentation of 15 minutes.

While you are free to propose your own agenda for these presentations, you must provide the following information to the audience for your assigned topic:
- How does the technology/framework works?
- When does it emerged and will it be still usable in the future in your opinion or shall it be superseded by something else?
- What are the situations when to use and when not to use your technology/framework/tool?
- How much does it costs (in hardware price tags, development time...)?
- Provide illustrative tasks where that technology excels and report what can be the gain in such settings (in the best situation for which it has been designed, what can be gained ?)
- Provide as much links as possible with topics with have seen during the lectures (Branch Prediction, Multi-Threading, SIMD,...)

Presentation and slides can be done in English or French, as you prefer.
